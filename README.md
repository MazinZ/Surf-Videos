Notes/Thoughts for improvement:

1. I’d like to learn more about how React organizes logic-driven code vs user-facing code. Typically in AngularJS, this is done via factories vs controllers & directives. For one piece of functionality I wrote an external module because I felt that placing some of the logic directly in the components limited reusability, but I’d like to learn more about general React design patterns.
2. More error handling — there are a few strange states that you can currently enter.
3. Possibly split up VideoBrowser into smaller components.

Overall, this was a really great intro into React!
